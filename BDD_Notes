BDD Cucumber :

1. Linear Scripting Framework - we need to code line by line

2. Modular Testing Framework

3. TestNG Framework - Data-Driven Framework

4. Keyword Driven Framework

5. Hybrid Framework

6. Behavior- Driven Development Framework (BDD)  TDD - Test Driven Development

=================================Traditional Development Process============


1. Stakeholders / End Users :

>login feature
>locgout feature
>product feature, list of products
>payment feature
>billing feature
>accounts, contact us

2. PO/BA :

>login feature
>locgout feature
>product feature, list of products
>Payment feature & Billing feature ( BA made assumption that dev team will craete then as separate pages)
>accounts, contact us ( BA made assumption that dev team will craete then as separate pages)

3. Development Team : these requirements documented by BA/PO are given to dev team

>login feature >code
>logout feature > code
> Product Page > Added from any legacy system and new product were missed
> Forgot to write Contact us feature

4. Test Team : these requirements documented by BA/PO are given to test team

>login feature - pass
>locgout feature - pass
>product feature, list of products - Fail - major bug
>Payment feature & Billing feature ( BA made assumption that dev team will craete then as separate pages) - found bugs
>accounts, contact us ( BA made assumption that dev team will craete then as separate pages) - missing requirement

=============Behaviour Driven Development Process=================


1. Stakeholders + PO + BA (Discuss about business requirements)

2. BA/PO + Dev + QA (discuss and collobrate on the requirements)

3. BA > Once all the requirement are agreed by stakeholders and 3 amigos thes req are fomatted using the language Gherkin -> Domain specific language
- Semi formal language. Easy to write and easy to read.

4. QA team will start writing manual test cases based on the formatted scenarios.

5. Developers will start coding for each scenarios, QA team can write the automation test scripts.

6. Finish the Build.

==============

Features                            Feature file name

Login				login.feature

Products                        product.feature

=============================================

Feature : Description of Page to be tested

Scenario : What test case you want to test

Given
When
Then
And 
But
===================================

Feature : User should send an email

Scenario : User should compose the email

Given I will open the chrome browser
When I enter the gmail.com as URL
Then I am on my mailbox, I will capture the title of the page
Then I will click on compose box
And I will write the content in email
Then I will click on send button.
And close the browser.
